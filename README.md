## Simple Go REST API for Book Management

This is a basic Go REST API implementation that enables CRUD operations on books. It demonstrates essential Go concepts and RESTful API design principles, serving as a solid foundation for your further exploration.

**Features:**

Performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on book resources.
Employs JSON request and response formats for clarity and interoperability.
Leverages HTTP status codes for meaningful feedback.
Adopts a modular structure for better organization and maintainability.
Includes clear instructions for setup and usage.

**Getting Started:**

**Prerequisites:**
    Go installation (https://golang.org/)
    A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, GoLand)

**Clone the repository:**
Bash

`git clone https://github.com/kipngeno-isaac/go-book-api.git`

Use code with caution. Learn more

**Install dependencies:**
Bash
```
cd go-book-api
go mod download
```

**Run the server:**
Bash

`go run main.go`

The server will typically start on port 8080, but refer to the code for actual configuration.

**Access the API:**

Use tools like Postman, curl, or your preferred REST client to interact with the API endpoints:

   | Method            | Endpoint               | Description
   | -------|------------ |-----------------------
   | POST     | /books     | Create a new book
   | GET      | /books     | Get a list of all books
   | GET      | /books/:id | Get details of a specific book
   | PUT      | /books/:id | Update an existing book
   | DELETE   | /books/:id | Delete a book

    Provide necessary data in the request body for creating or updating books. The response will be in JSON format, indicating success or failure along with specific error messages if applicable.

**Example Request (POST):**

POST /books HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```
{
  "title": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",
  "author": "Douglas Adams",
  "year": 1979
}
```
**Example Response (POST):**
JSON
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",
  "author": "Douglas Adams",
  "year": 1979,
  "created_at": "2024-02-15T17:23:45Z"
}
```

**Customization and Enhancement:**

Modify data validation and error handling to meet your specific requirements.
Implement user authentication and authorization for advanced security.
Integrate with a database for persistent storage.
Add search and filtering functionalities.
Consider performance optimization and scalability for larger datasets or user loads.
